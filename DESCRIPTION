Description: This package contains probability and moment functions for stationary Gaussian ARMA processes and the stationary GARMA distribution.
    The package contains functions to compute the auto-covariance/auto-correlation function for a stationary Gaussian ARMA process, and functions
    giving the density, cumulative distribution, or random generation, from a stationary GARMA distribution.  The package also contains functions 
    to compute the spectral intensity of a time-series vector and perform a permutation-spectrum test.
