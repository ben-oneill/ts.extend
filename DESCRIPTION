Description: Stationary Gaussian ARMA processes and the stationary 'GARMA' distribution are fundamental in time series analysis. The permutation-spectrum
    test can detect a periodic signal in a real or complex time-series. Utilities to compute the auto-covariance/auto-correlation for a 
    stationary Gaussian ARMA process, as well as the density, cumulative distribution, and spectral intensity are also implemented, as is 
    random series generation.
